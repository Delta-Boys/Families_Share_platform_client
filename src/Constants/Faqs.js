      question: "How does the group work?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Each group can decide how to organize the shifts and manage the
          schedule rotation. In general, within a group the time put at the
          disposal by every parent should be as balanced as possible, with every
          parent offering about the same amount of time. However, every
          different or additional rule has to be discussed offline and approved
          by all group members.

      question: "What happens if I am not able to comply with my shift?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          In case you cannot participate, first of all you have to immediately
          contact the group administrator(s) to find a solution. The preferred
          solution is to find a parent of the group who can substitute you. In
          case it is not feasible, it is possible to involve external childcare
          professional or cancel the turn and the activity. However, this last
          option should be adopted only in the case other solutions are not
          possible, in order not to cause difficulties to the other families.
          However, it is recommended to groups to decide in advance, once the
          group is formed, how to deal with such inconvenientes (for instance
          decide if the involvement of external professional can be an option or
          not)

          In case you are afraid in managing a group of children, our experience
          with the parents who took part to previous Families Share activities
          taught us that the worry is understandable but not real, since in
          reality everything is easier than how it seems. Listen to the stories
          of the parents who last summer took part to Families Share activities

          <p>
            For an optimal group management and for safety reasons, we recommend
            not to exceed the ratio parents-children 1:6. Have a look to the
            special needs of children participating to shared activities (i.e.
            allergies, intolerances, and other special needs) by exporting the
            activities’ info. In case of emergency, contact the first aid and
            inform the group administrator as well as the child’s parents
            through the contacts available in the members’ section of the
            app/platform. Keep emergency numbers on hand:

      question: "How can I create a new group?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          The first step to enter the Families Share world is to create a new
          group of parents. You can involve your personal network and set up
          your own group, by selecting “create a group” and inviting your
          friends to join, or search for an existing group in the area
          (selecting the option ‘search group’) and ask to join it, as a single
          parent or with your group, by contacting the administrator.

    {
      question: "Which activities can I organize?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Through the app Families Share every kind of childcare activity can be
          organized: co-playing week or days during school holidays, activities
          of accompanying/picking up children to/from school, extra school or
          after school activities, touristic visits, etc.Through the app parents
          schedule the activities identifying different timeslots. Later you can
          register yourself and/or your children for joining the activities.

    {
      question: "Which is the role of the group administrator?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          The group administrator plays a central role within the Families Share
          platform. First of all, he/she creates the group and he/she is the
          contact person who can be contacted by users, external to the group,
          to ask information about it. The group administrator also adds new
          members to the group. Moreover, the administrator can edit the
          activities and the timeslots, he/she can export the group’s
          information as well as the activity’s details, also once the activity
          has taken place.The administrator sets the group features
          (visible/invisible) and he/she has the control on the advanced
          planning activity.Finally, the administrator can decide to make
          administrator some other members. There isn’t a maximum number of
          administrators within a group, every member can be set as such. We
          suggest to have at least two people with the administrative role
          within a group.

          <p>
            The first thing to do when a child is missing is to alert his/her
            parents if they were not co-playing. Look in the immediate area.
            Older children have a tendency to have run to friends’ houses, so
            call around to any friends, family, or neighbors who are close to
            your child. If the child is not found, call the police, which is
            required to enter immediately the missing child’s name and
            information into the national system, to broaden the research. Be
            prepared to provide as much key information as you can, as for
            instance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Child’s full name</li>
            <li> Child’s weight</li>
            <li>Child’s height</li>
            <li>Child’s age and date of birth</li>
            <li>Clothes the child was last seen wearing</li>
            <li>dentifying features, like glasses or a birthmark</li>
            <li>
              Names and contact information of the child’s friends or close
              acquaintances
            </li>
            <li>Frequently visited hangout spots</li>
            <li>Health issues the child has</li>

              child went missing Parents of the chlid and the co-playing parents

            If a child injures him/herself there are different possible actions

          Ogni gruppo è libero di decidere come organizzarsi nella gestione dei
          turni. In generale, all’interno di un gruppo il tempo messo a
          disposizione da ciascun genitore dovrebbe essere il più possibile
          equilibrato , in modo da assicurare un impegno in termini di tempo
          analogo fra i membri del gruppo. Regole diverse o ulteriori devono
          essere discusse e concordate offline tra i membri del gruppo.

        <p>
          Nel caso in cui non riuscissi a rispettare il tuo turno, la prima cosa
          da fare è contattare tempestivamente l’amministratore (o gli
          amministratori) del gruppo per cercare insieme una soluzione. La
          soluzione preferibile è individuare un altro genitore del gruppo che
          possa sostituirti. Nel caso in cui ciò non fosse possibile, è
          possibile ricorrere a figure professionali esterne e dichiararlo
          all’interno del tuo orario di attività, modificando la disponibilità
          nel turno con “user esterno”. Se anche ciò non fosse possibile, si
          dovrà procedere con la cancellazione del proprio turno e, quindi,
          dell’attività. Quest’ultima soluzione, tuttavia, dovrebbe essere
          adottata solo nei casi in cui non vi siano alternative di altro tipo,
          al fine di non creare disagio alle altre famiglie. Si invitano i
          gruppi a decidere già al momento della costituzione del gruppo come
          agire in queste situazioni (decidendo, in particolare se ricorrere ad
          un servizio di baby-sitting o altre figure professionali esterne al
          gruppo).

            1:6 . Verifica i bisogni speciali (allergie, intolleranze e altri
            bisogni) dei bambini che partecipano alle attività esportando le

      answer: (
        <p>
          L’amministratore di un gruppo svolge un ruolo centrale nella
          piattaforma Families Share. Innanzitutto è la persona che crea il
          gruppo ed è il referente che può essere contattato da utenti esterni
          al gruppo per avere informazioni sullo stesso.In secondo luogo,
          l’amministratore può invitare altre persone ad unirsi al gruppo e può
          modificare le attività e gli orari delle stesse; può esportare
          l’attività e riceverne i dettagli, ed esportare i documenti e
          analitiche finali a conclusione dell’attività. L’amministratore
          imposta le caratteristiche del gruppo (visibile/invisibile) ed ha il
          controllo sull’attività di pianificazione avanzata.Infine,
          l’amministratore può decidere quali altri membri rendere
          amministratori. Non c’è un numero massimo di amministratori
          all’interno del gruppo, ogni membro può essere impostato come tale.
          Consigliamo di avere almeno due persone con il ruolo di amministratore
          all’interno di un gruppo.

            Older children have a tendency to have run to friends’ houses, so
            call around to any friends, family, or neighbors who are close to
            your child. If the child is not found, call the police, which is

      question: "How does the group work?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Each group can decide how to organize the shifts and manage the
          schedule rotation. In general, within a group the time put at the
          disposal by every parent should be as balanced as possible, with every
          parent offering about the same amount of time. However, every
          different or additional rule has to be discussed offline and approved
          by all group members.

      )

      question: "What happens if I am not able to comply with my shift?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          In case you cannot participate, first of all you have to immediately
          contact the group administrator(s) to find a solution. The preferred
          solution is to find a parent of the group who can substitute you. In
          case it is not feasible, it is possible to involve external childcare
          professional or cancel the turn and the activity. However, this last
          option should be adopted only in the case other solutions are not
          possible, in order not to cause difficulties to the other families.
          However, it is recommended to groups to decide in advance, once the
          group is formed, how to deal with such inconvenientes (for instance
          decide if the involvement of external professional can be an option or
          not)

          In case you are afraid in managing a group of children, our experience
          with the parents who took part to previous Families Share activities
          taught us that the worry is understandable but not real, since in
          reality everything is easier than how it seems. Listen to the stories
          of the parents who last summer took part to Families Share activities
          in our YouTube channel Families - Share EU

          <p>
            For an optimal group management and for safety reasons, we recommend
            not to exceed the ratio parents-children 1:6. Have a look to the
            special needs of children participating to shared activities (i.e.
            allergies, intolerances, and other special needs) by exporting the
            activities’ info. In case of emergency, contact the first aid and
            inform the group administrator as well as the child’s parents
            through the contacts available in the members’ section of the
            app/platform. Keep emergency numbers on hand:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ambulance/first aid 118 </li>

      question: "How can I create a new group?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          The first step to enter the Families Share world is to create a new
          group of parents. You can involve your personal network and set up
          your own group, by selecting “create a group” and inviting your
          friends to join, or search for an existing group in the area
          (selecting the option ‘search group’) and ask to join it, as a single
          parent or with your group, by contacting the administrator.

    {
      question: "Which activities can I organize?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Through the app Families Share every kind of childcare activity can be
          organized: co-playing week or days during school holidays, activities
          of accompanying/picking up children to/from school, extra school or
          after school activities, touristic visits, etc.Through the app parents
          schedule the activities identifying different timeslots. Later you can
          register yourself and/or your children for joining the activities.

    {
      question: "Which is the role of the group administrator?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          The group administrator plays a central role within the Families Share
          platform. First of all, he/she creates the group and he/she is the
          contact person who can be contacted by users, external to the group,
          to ask information about it. The group administrator also adds new
          members to the group. Moreover, the administrator can edit the
          activities and the timeslots, he/she can export the group’s
          information as well as the activity’s details, also once the activity
          has taken place.The administrator sets the group features
          (visible/invisible) and he/she has the control on the advanced
          planning activity.Finally, the administrator can decide to make
          administrator some other members. There isn’t a maximum number of
          administrators within a group, every member can be set as such. We
          suggest to have at least two people with the administrative role
          within a group.

      answer: (

          <p>
            The first thing to do when a child is missing is to alert his/her
            parents if they were not co-playing. Look in the immediate area.
            Older children have a tendency to have run to friends’ houses, so
            call around to any friends, family, or neighbors who are close to
            your child. If the child is not found, call the police, which is
            required to enter immediately the missing child’s name and
            information into the national system, to broaden the research. Be
            prepared to provide as much key information as you can, as for
            instance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Child’s full name</li>
            <li> Child’s weight</li>
            <li>Child’s height</li>
            <li>Child’s age and date of birth</li>
            <li>Clothes the child was last seen wearing</li>
            <li>dentifying features, like glasses or a birthmark</li>
            <li>
              Names and contact information of the child’s friends or close
              acquaintances
            </li>
            <li>Frequently visited hangout spots</li>
            <li>Health issues the child has</li>
            <li>
              Any other possibly relevant details about the time or place the
              child went missing Parents of the chlid and the co-playing parents
              need to keep their phone line open.
